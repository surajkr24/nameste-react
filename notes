Q. what is CDN ?
=> CDN stands for content delivery network that speeds up web page loading for data-heavy applications.
The primary purpose of the CDN is to reduce latency, or reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design. Because of the
global and complex nature of the internet, communication traffic between websites(servers) and their users (clients) has to move over large 
physical distances. The communication is also two way, with requests going from the client to the server and responds coming back.
A CDN improves efficency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website servers. These CDN servers manage some of
the client-server communications. They decreace web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user
experience of our app;ications.


Q. what is CrossOrigin ?
=> CrossOrigin refers to interactions between web pages from different domains. CORS is a security feature that allows servers to specify 
which domains are permitted to access their resources, ensuring secure cross-origin requests.
